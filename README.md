# Top-Rated-Products-Amazon-Webscraper
The program (FinalWebscraper.py) uses a web scraping algorithm to grab the top-rated camping items from amazon mentioned in a camping checklist to make it easier for campers to be prepared when going outside. In order to add a bit of fun to the project we added an AI that could generate camping related images based off a name input into a text box by users who will receive their images on their phone.
# How We Built It 
We used beautiful soup and selenium to scrape several top-rated items off of Amazon based on the items in our checklist. The items are filtered out if they contain too few reviews to ensure quality of the products.
# Other Aspects of the Project
